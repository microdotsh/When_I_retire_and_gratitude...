This project started when trying to distribute content via SMS to so many recipients that it was becoming cumbersome. (Device software doesn't support RCS)

I created a BASH script to read a number file stored on my Android device and send the content of a seperate text file.

Even with delays between each message, my carrier was filtering messages. They were being sent but dropped before getting to the recipient. (Added shuffle of contacts to randomize order and randomized delays to look more human.)

Ultimately, because the content was so much, I decided to use the index.html here for the content, add pages and distribute the link instead.
